# Constructor

Video Tutorial:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fbwW_cLI4w4


This is a command line program that utilizes constructors to create a hangman like game. 
The challenge really solidified the concept of importing and exporting data from other .js files and also using constructor to condense code and make it cleaner and easier to read in the future.

The way the game works is you first open the folder in node and run "node index.js" to start the program. 
Once it starts running it will prompt you enter a letter.
It then keeps track of all incorrect letters as well as inserts correct letters into their respective places. 
When the incorrect letters exceed a certain number or all the correct letters are guessed the game will review the correct word,  tally up the win or loss and start a new game.

I had fun making this, I hope you enjoy my program.
